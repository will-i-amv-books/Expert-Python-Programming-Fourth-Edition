    "Definitions of concurrency:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Concurrency is not the same as parallelism. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Concurrency is not a matter of application implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Concurrency can be defined as follows: \"Two events are concurrent if neither can causally affect the other.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* In other words, something is concurrent if it can be fully or partially decomposed into components (units) that are order-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common application scenarios where concurrent processing is a viable approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Processing distribution: The scale of the problem is so big that the only way to process it in an acceptable time frame (with constrained resources) is to distribute execution on multiple processing units that can handle the work in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Application responsiveness: Your application needs to maintain responsiveness (accept new inputs), even if it did not finish processing previous inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Background processing: Not every task needs to be performed in a synchronous way. If there is no need to immediately access the results of a specific action, it may be reasonable to defer execution in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's tools to deal with concurrency:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multithreading: \n",
    "    * Running multiple threads of execution that share the memory context of the parent process. \n",
    "    * The execution of threads is coordinated by the OS kernel.\n",
    "    * It works best in applications that do a lot of I/O operations or need to maintain UI responsiveness. \n",
    "    * Very lightweight, but comes with caveats and memory safety risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiprocessing: \n",
    "    * Running multiple independent processes to perform work in a distributed manner. \n",
    "    * Similar to threads in operation, but there's no shared memory context. \n",
    "    * Due to Python's GIL limitaton, it's better suited for CPU-intensive applications. \n",
    "    * More heavyweight than multithreading and requires implementing inter-process communication patterns to orchestrate work between processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Asynchronous programming: \n",
    "    * Running multiple cooperative tasks within a single application process. \n",
    "    * Cooperative tasks work like threads, but switching between them is done by the application, not the OS kernel. \n",
    "    * Well suited to I/O-bound applications, especially for programs that need to handle multiple simultaneous network connections. \n",
    "    * The downside of asynchronous programming is the need to use dedicated asynchronous libraries.\n",
